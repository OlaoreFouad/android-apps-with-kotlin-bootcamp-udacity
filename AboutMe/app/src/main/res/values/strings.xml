    Hi!, my name is Olaore Fouad\n
    I really do not know a lot about what I like or don\'t. But if anything is dear to me, it\'s my family.\n
    They mean the world to me, and I can do anything for them. They keep pushing mentally, and they keep giving me a reason to keep learning.\n\n
    I also love eating food, people call me Foodie too. Not because of my eating habits, but because my first name is: Fouad. Get it.\n\n
    I am also a developer of amazing applications. All of which are on my emulator, or on my browser history\n\n
    If you know&#8320; you know&#8320;
